# Cloud Computing

Cloud solutions ae not only related to increased volume of data, but also to changes in the inflow of data.

**Cloud computing** refers to a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.

Cloud characteristics:

- On-demand self-service (consume services when you want)
- Broad network access (consume services from anywhere)
- Resource pooling (infrastructure, virtual platforms and applications)
- Rapid elasticity (enable horizontal scalability)
- Measures service (pay for the service you consume as you consume)

Digital transformation involves the cloud to create/change business flows.

The main drivers of cloud computing are:

- **Scalability** (not possible on premises)
- **Elasticity**
    - Automatically scale resources in response to run-time conditions
    - Adapt to changes in workload by turning on/off resources to match the necessary capacity
    - Core justification for the cloud adoption
- **Resource pooling**
    - Cost-sharing (resources are dynamically reassigned according to demands)
    - Economy of scale
    - Based on virtualization, running multiple virtual instances on top of a physical computer system
- **Reliability** (handle failures and highly available)
- **Worldwide deployment** 
- Measured **quality of service** (services leverage a quantitative qualitative metering capability making pay-as-you-go)
- **Service integration**
    - Abstract and automatically adapt the architecture to requirements
    - Integration and abstraction are drivers of change

Cloud computing is the outsourcing of a company's hardware and software architecture.
The risks involved include:

- Vendor Lock-in
- Storage
- No control over data (security)

## Types of Service Providers

There different types of cloud:

- **Public** (accessible to anyone like Microsoft, AWS, Google ...)
- **Private** (accessible by individuals within an institution)
    - Cost-sharing disappears in private clouds
    - Security
- **Hybrid** (a mix of the previous)

Cloud services are hosted in separate geographic areas.
Locations are composed of regions (independent geographical area that groups data centers) and availability zones (data center).

## Deployment Models

On a cloud architecture, you can rely on serverless or managed services.

**Serverless service**

- Standalone independent services built for a specific purpose and integrated by cloud service provider
- No visibility into the machines
- Pay for what your application uses, usually per request or per usage

**(Fully) Managed service**

- Visibility and control of machines
- Do not have to set up any machines, the management and backup are taken care for you
- Pay for machine runtime no matter how long you run the machines and resources that your application uses
