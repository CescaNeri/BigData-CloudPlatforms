# Bit Bang

BitBang was founded in 2003, with vision that data is the most powerful asset for businesses.

Their **mission** is to empower business transformation and data-driven decision making.

## Digital Transformation Program

The customer is a famous group in the luxury (fashion) industry. Brands need to provide the same special experience customers get in boutique in the digital world. 
The idea is to have **showrooms** in which people can browse in-store and buy online.
At the same time, people can browse people online, see all the information they need, and then go to physical shops to buy the product (**web-rooming**)

*People buy experiences not products*

But is it possible to buy experiences on the web? The idea is to collect data at every **touchpoint** and measure the experience using those data.
This process is very difficult as it regards qualitative perceptions rather than quantitative data.

The goal is to create experience, beyond people's expectations, starting from data and analytics. To do so, the company leverage ML and AI for automation and **real-time personalization**.
