- **Analytics**
    - Umbrella term that include different BI and application-related initiatives

## Data Platform

Getting **value** from data is not (only) a matter of storage.

**Database**

A database is a **structured** and persistent collection of information about some aspect of the real world organized and stored in a way that facilitates efficient retrieval and modification.
The structure of a database is determined by an abstract data model.

**Data Warehouse**

A collection of data that supports decision-making processes.
It provides the following features:

- Subject-oriented
- Integrated and consistent
- Not volatile

Depending on the application or the workload, we need to identify the most suitable data model to adopt.
