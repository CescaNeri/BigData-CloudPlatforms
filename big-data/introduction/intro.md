# Big Data

Nowadays, we produce more data than the capability of analyzing them.

- Data grows faster than energy on chip

SKA telescope produce 3TB every second. 
They cannot store all the data but they need to analyze them and store the results.

# Big Data - Definition

How can we distinguish big data from normal data?
The line is quite vague


>Big data exceeds the reach of commonly used hardware environments and software tools to capture, manage, and process it within a tolerable elapsed time for its user population

> *- Teradata*

We can define Big Data following the V's principles:

- VOLUME (dataset that are particularly big)
- VELOCITY - interpreted in two ways:
    - velocity in which data are injected 
    - speed of the analysis that you want to run
- VARIETY (many different formats of data)
    - structured vs semi-structured (JSON)
- VERACITY (in many cases, you are dealing with datasets which you cannot fully rely on)
    - especially true when you are dealing with social data

The 'V' concept can be extended but we only consider the first four as they are the main ones.

## Big Data Hype

Big Data comes mainly from two phenomenons:

- Explosion of social networks
- IoT (sensors, smart cities, wearables, industry 4.0)

The data that comes from these two sources is quite enormous with respect to the amount of data produced by companies. 

**The Long Tail Model** - Pareto Rule *reversed*

The highest value does not come from the small set of highly popular items, but from the long list of niche items.

- Insignificant data is actually the most valuable.

The possibility to handle large amount of data makes you smarter. Sometimes, no complex algorithm is needed:

Google Translate just collects snippets of translations, match it with a long list of translations stored in their dataset, and return the most used one.

- The system is continuously debugged.

## Success Stories

- German National Football Team

They applied data analysis to football and they won the 2016 world championship.

- Crime Prevention in LA
- Diagnosis and Treatment of Genetic Disease 
- Investments in the Financial Sector
- Astronomical Discoveries
- Injury Prevention of Football Players

## Todays' Opportunities and Use Cases

1. Healthcare (remote monitoring, preventive care, reduced hospitalization, improved system efficiency)
2. Manufacturing (sensors)
3. Location-Based Services
4. Public Sector (citizen surveys)
5. Retail (social media)

## Privacy

Marketing campaigns are particularly effective when costumers are going through a change (maternity, new job, lifestyle).
A company wanted to send advertising about maternity products BEFORE the baby was actually born. They were able to identify patterns of behaviors adopted by costumers when a baby was coming. 
However, the company incurred in legal issues because they sent maternity adv to a 16 y.o girl who did not inform the parents about the pregnancy.
The company won the legal dispute but it raised some concerns regarding privacy.
